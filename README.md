Welcome to **VARCem**, the Virtual Archaeological Computer EMulator.

VARCem8 is a software application which emulates a selection of
8-bit microprocessors, auxiliary I/O devices and, of course, a
(small) number of systems they were used in.

The program tries to be cycle-exact, meaning the guest software
(the software being run inside the emulated system) will run as
fast (or, depending on how you see that..) as slow as it did
"back then".  If you selected, say, a 65C02 running at 2MHz,
that is what the software will see, and how fast it will be
run.


HISTORY
-------
VARCem8 is a subproject of the larger VARCem Systems Emulator
project. It was felt that the 8-bit "world" was SO much different
from the "PC world", a separate application was desired.


LICENSE
-------
VARCem as a whole is released under the BSD 3-Clause Open Software
License, which is compatible with the GPL (GNU Public License)
version 2 or later that is used by many of the modules imported
from other emulator projects. Major parts of the VARCem8 project
are released under the MIT license.

Author credits and specific copyrights can be found in each of
the source files.

Obviously, where license terms of individual modules deviate from
the general project license terms, the terms of such an individual
module prevail.

It's free, it comes with all the sources, but it does not come with
any warranty whatsoever. You probably should not use this software to run
a business-critical piece of (old) software at work, for example.

If there is a problem with the software, please open up a GIT issue so we
can work on it, and/or talk to us on the IRC channel. We cannot promise a
fix, but will try the best we can !
